This code has been implemented in Matlab 2023b, using EEGLAB (2021.0) and Fieldtrip (2023-12-20). 

# Instructions

To run the scripts, open Matlab and add the additional_functions folder to the path 

Use behavior.m to reproduce the behavioral results (Fig. 1)

Use power_analysis to reproduce the theta power results (Fig. 2) 

Use contrast_based_RSA.m to reproduce the main effects of item stability and item specificity (Figs. 3-4)

Use trial_level_analysis.m to perform the coordination analyses in all ROIs (Figs 3-5)
